This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: using the `delete` operator on a stack-allocated variable. The `bug.cpp` file shows the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.cpp` file shows the corrected code.  The `delete` keyword is used to free memory allocated on the heap using `new`.  Attempting to use it on a stack-allocated variable like `x` will lead to unpredictable behavior and potentially crashes.
